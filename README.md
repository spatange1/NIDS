# NIDS

An algorithm is introduced in this project for network intrusion detection by combining Naïve Bayes classifier and decision tree. The combination of naïve bayes and decision tree algorithms helps in balancing the detections and ensures that the false positives are at acceptable levels for various types of attacks in the network. Since the behavior of the intrusion in the network is complex and rapidly changing, multiple data mining-based intrusion detection methods have been experimented on network-based traffic data and host-based data in the last few years. However, there are few problems that occur and need to be examined to improve the Intrusion Detection System (IDS). KDD99 intrusion detection dataset has been used in the proposed algorithm. After performing experiments on the proposed algorithm, it can be proven that the combination algorithm accomplished high detection rates (DR) and vastly reduced false positives (FP) for different types of network intrusions.
